Building is not required. The file bin/codegen is an executable script. Usage (within asgn2/ directory):
    bin/codegen <source-filename>.ir

In order to save the output from a test file test.ir in an assembly code file use:
    bin/codegen test.ir > test.s

To create executable binary from the test.s file created above, use:
    gcc -m32 test.s -o test

  Note that we supplied the -m32 flag to gcc, because we output 32-bit assembly code (ia32 ISA).
  Furthermore, we have added a 'main' function as a wrapper for our program so that gcc can figure
  out the start point of the program.
